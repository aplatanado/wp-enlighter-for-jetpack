== Description ==

This is a simple plugin to improve the integration of Enlighter with Jetpack. Currently it only maps a [code] shortcode (that is added by Jetpack when it finds a markdown fenced code block) to a [enlighter] shortcode.

This plugin depends on [Enlighter - Customizable Syntax Highlighter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enlighter/).
